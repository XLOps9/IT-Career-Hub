      <p>
        The IT workforce is expanding rapidly, with job demand increasing due to
        the continued digital transformation of industries, emerging
        technologies, and the growing need for cybersecurity professionals.

        to grow at an above-average pace, with an expected 13% increase in
        employment from 2020 to 2030. Specialized roles in cybersecurity, AI,
        cloud computing, and data science are expected to see the strongest
        growth.

        workers entering the field.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="highlight">Factors Impacting the Workforce:</span> The
        increasing demand for specialized skills, combined with a growing
        emphasis on diversity, upskilling, and the global talent shortage, will
        shape the future of the IT workforce.
