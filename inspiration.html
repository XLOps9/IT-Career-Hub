      <h2>Inspirational Example: Michael Bloomberg</h2>
      <p>
        Michael Bloomberg started his career as a general partner at Salomon
        Brothers investment bank and, after being demoted to the IT division and
        laid off, saw an opportunity. His IT experience laid the groundwork for
        what would become Bloomberg LP, transforming trading with rapid data
        access. Bloomberg expanded into media with Bloomberg News and TV,
        solidifying his influence. His journey showcases that career setbacks
        can lead to greater success when paired with insight and perseverance.
